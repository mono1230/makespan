# makespan
To run the makespan implementation code:
  -Go to MakeSpanExperiment Folder
  -Run the code named "Main.py"
  -The result will be saved in "result.txt"
  
Note:
  -Because of the different values of the first param in zipf distribution, the result on Rand algorithm varies. Currently, the value
   is set as 2.0. Since I generated the first result table in the paper, I tried some different values but couldn't reproduce a result
   like the first.
  -Firstly, I generated some zipf sequences and ran the Rand algorithm 10 times and took the average.
  -But now, because of the random values and the first parameter changes of zipf distribution, Rand is giving the different result.
